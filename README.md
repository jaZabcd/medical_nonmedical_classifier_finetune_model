# üß† Medical Image Classifier

## üìå Overview
The **Medical Image Classifier** is a deep learning‚Äìbased application that can automatically classify images as **medical** or **non-medical**.  
It supports two input types:
- Extracting and classifying **all images from a webpage URL**
- Extracting and classifying **all images from a PDF file**

This tool is useful for hospitals, research labs, and academic projects where large collections of images need to be sorted quickly and accurately.

## üöÄ Features
- **High Accuracy** ‚Äì Fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model with near-perfect classification results.
- **Multi-Input Support** ‚Äì Classify images from both URLs and PDF files.
- **Performance Metrics** ‚Äì Displays total inference time, average inference time per image, throughput, and model size.
- **History Tracking** ‚Äì Stores recent classification results in session history for easy reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface** ‚Äì Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

## üèó Model Architecture
The model is based on **EfficientNet-B0** and has been **fine-tuned** for the binary classification task.  
Key steps in the fine-tuning process:
1. **Base Model Selection** ‚Äì EfficientNet-B0 pre-trained on ImageNet for strong general image features.
2. **Custom Classification Layer** ‚Äì Replaced the original classification head with:
   - Global Average Pooling
   - Fully Connected Layer
   - Dropout for regularization
   - Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification
3. **Data Augmentation** ‚Äì Applied random rotations, flips, and normalization to improve generalization.
4. **Training Strategy** ‚Äì Used Adam optimizer with a learning rate scheduler for stable convergence.
5. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Tested on ~450 images for both accuracy and speed.
